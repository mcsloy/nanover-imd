# Nanover iMD

Interactive Molecular Dynamics (iMD) in VR, an application built with the Nanover
framework.

See [the list of contributors](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for the individual authors of the project.

# Run the latest development build

To run Nanover iMD, you need [SteamVR](https://www.steamvr.com/) installed.

* Download the [latest Windows build](https://github.com/IRL2/nanover-imd/releases/download/nightly/StandaloneWindows64.zip) from the [nightly release](https://github.com/IRL2/nanover-imd/releases/tag/nightly).
* Extract the downloaded zip file.
* In the extracted directory, launch `StandaloneWindows64.exe`. Windows will likely prompt you with a warning about the executable not being signed. If it happens, click on the "More info" button, then "Run anyway". You will also likely be prompted by the Windows firewall, allow Nanover to access the network.

# Installation with conda

If you've not already set up anaconda:

* Install Anaconda (avoid Anaconda 2.7 as it is outdated)
* Start the "Anaconda Powershell Prompt" where to type the next commands
* Create a conda environment (here we call the environment "nanover"): `conda create -n nanover "python>3.6"`
* Activate the conda environment: `conda activate nanover`

Then:

* Install the Nanover IMD package:

```
conda install -c irl nanover-imd
```

Run it! In the powershell prompt (Start Menu integration coming soon):

```
NanoverImd
```
